## 💻 Server/Client Configurations and Console

### **Q:** How can I access the admin menu?
Pressing backslash (`\`) will bring up the admin menu.  
* This works on a `QWERTY` keyboard with a `US` keyboard layout.
* If (`\`) does not work, you may be required to use the `Insert` key.
* If neither work, you may need to manually map your `Admin Menu` bind in your `GameUserSettings.ini`.

### **Q:** Which configuration (`.ini`) files are required for VEIN?
There are four (4) files located in the `Saved` path of your game client/server installation.

**Server and Client Configurations:**
* `Engine.ini`
* `Game.ini`

**Client Configurations Only:**
* `GameUserSettings.ini`
* `Input.ini`

## 🌐 Server API & Remote Management

<a name="httpapi"></a>
### **Q:** How do I enable and use the game server's HTTP API?
The API allows for real-time monitoring of server data (Time, Weather, Players).
* Enable the API in your `Engine.ini` under the `[/Script/Vein.VeinHTTPServer]` section.
* Set your desired port (default is `8089`).
* You can query data using tools like `curl` or build custom dashboards to visualize server status, character profiles, and weather (temperature/wind direction).

<a name="rcon"></a>
### **Q:** How can I send commands remotely (RCON)?
VEIN does not currently support RCON.
* Please refer to the `#vein-modding` channel on the official Discord for more information on administration tools.
* Using the `\` admin menu is the currently supported and recommended method for server management.

<a name="troubleshooting"></a>
## ⚠️ Common Troubleshooting

<a name="serverbrowserappearing"></a>
### **Q:** My server isn't appearing in the server browser. Why?
* **Port Forwarding:** Ensure the game port (`7777`) and query port (`27015`) are open on your router/firewall.
* **IP Binding:** Unless you have a specific reason not to, check that your `Engine.ini` is correctly bound to all interfaces using `DefaultBindAddress = 0.0.0.0`.
* **Version Mismatch:** Ensure both the server and your client are on the same branch (e.g., both on Experimental). 

<a name="startupcrashes"></a>
### **Q:** The game crashes on startup or when loading a save.
* **Verify Integrity:** *Right-click* the game in `Steam > Properties > Installed Files > Verify Integrity of Game Files`.
* **Clear Config:** Temporarily move your `Saved/Config` folder to the desktop and restart to see if a corrupted `.ini` file is the cause.
* **Update Drivers:** Ensure your GPU drivers are up to date (Windows/Linux).

<a name="multiplayercommands"></a>
### **Q:** How do I run a console command on my multiplayer server?
* **Admin privledges:** You can access your multiplayer server's admin and console menu by first adding the `steam64id` of the player to the `Game.ini` file, into either the `AdminSteamIDs` or `SuperAdmin` values
* **Admin Menu vs Console:** You can access the console using the `~` developer options, but most commands will not work without first appending the `ServerExec` prefix to the command.  It is recommended that you use the game's `Admin Menu`, which can typically be accessed using the `\` or `Insert` keys.

`vein.AISpawner.SpawnCapMultiplierZombie=5` - as an example this would set your AI's zombie multiplier slider to 5x
This can also be adjusted manually by accessing the `Engine.ini` file within your server's file configuration location.

<a name="televisionprojectormp4"></a>
### **Q:** How do I use the television or projector with `.mp4` files?
* Select the television/projector, then `Examine Connections` and add electricity from any electricity source such as a panel on the wall, a generator.
* **For URL:**
  * Select your source by changing it to `URL`, then click on `Select URL or file` and either type in your URL into the entry prompt, or you can copy and paste the link from a known URL with an existing `.mp4` extension.
  * Turn the television from the Off to the On position
  * Press the `Play` button near the top of your television/projector menu, or switch your source until you are able to select `URL`
* **For File:**
  *   * Select your source by changing it to `File`, then click on `Select URL or file`.  You will see a list of any file ending with an `.mp4` extension from the path your movie files are located in.  
  * Turn the television from the Off to the On position
  * Press the `Play` button near the top of your television/projector menu, or switch your source until you are able to select `File`
* **Notes and limitations regarding `.mp4` playback:**
  * Not every `.mp4` file will work correctly within Vein, due to issues relating to codecs or malformed files.
  * There are known playback issues with the native Linux libraries, using Proton (hotfix) works in some instances.
  * The current implementation of the server and client code have varying effects and a few reported bugs relating to television and projector playback.  **We encourage you to visit the developer's Discord server and to [report any suggestions or bugs there, or through the game's feedback system](#reporting)**
* **Notes on multi-player:**
  * If you are playing with friends, all of you must have the same access to the URL.  Playback and timing may not be in synch.
  * When trying to play a local file, all of you must have the same `.mp4` files within your [Vein `Movies` location]()

### **Q:** How do I use the television or projector with security cameras?
**Required:**  Adding electricity to both the camera and television **is required.**
* Install your security camera.
  * Select the camera:
    * `Examine Connections` and connect it to an electrical source.

    * *If you don't immediately see the camera feed*, switch your source until you've selected `Camera` again.
**More than one camera:**
  * If you intend on having more than a single camera, you can select between the cameras and select through them with the `Next Camera` and `Previous Camera` options.
**Notes on video and audio playback file formats:**

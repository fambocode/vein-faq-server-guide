## 💻 Server/Client Configurations and Console

### **Q:** How can I access the admin menu?
Pressing backslash (`\`) will bring up the admin menu.  
* This works on a `QWERTY` keyboard with a `US` keyboard layout.
* If (`\`) does not work, you may be required to use the `Insert` key.
* If neither work, you may need to manually map your `Admin Menu` bind in your `GameUserSettings.ini`.

### **Q:** Which configuration (`.ini`) files are required for VEIN?
There are four (4) files located in the `Saved` path of your game client/server installation.

**Server and Client Configurations:**
* `Engine.ini`
* `Game.ini`

**Client Configurations Only:**
* `GameUserSettings.ini`
* `Input.ini`

## 🌐 Server API & Remote Management

### **Q:** How do I enable and use the game server's HTTP API?
The API allows for real-time monitoring of server data (Time, Weather, Players).
* Enable the API in your `Engine.ini` under the `[/Script/Vein.VeinHTTPServer]` section.
* Set your desired port (default is `8089`).
* You can query data using tools like `curl` or build custom dashboards to visualize server status, character profiles, and weather (temperature/wind direction).

### **Q:** How can I send commands remotely (RCON)?
VEIN does not currently support RCON.
* Please refer to the `#vein-modding` channel on the official Discord for more information on administration tools.
* Using the `\` admin menu is the currently supported and recommended method for server management.

## ⚠️ Common Troubleshooting

### **Q:** My server isn't appearing in the server browser. Why?
* **Port Forwarding:** Ensure the game port (`7777`) and query port (`27015`) are open on your router/firewall.
* **IP Binding:** Unless you have a specific reason not to, check that your `Engine.ini` is correctly bound to all interfaces using `DefaultBindAddress = 0.0.0.0`.
* **Version Mismatch:** Ensure both the server and your client are on the same branch (e.g., both on Experimental). 

### **Q:** The game crashes on startup or when loading a save.
* **Verify Integrity:** *Right-click* the game in `Steam > Properties > Installed Files > Verify Integrity of Game Files`.
* **Clear Config:** Temporarily move your `Saved/Config` folder to the desktop and restart to see if a corrupted `.ini` file is the cause.
* **Update Drivers:** Ensure your GPU drivers are up to date (Windows/Linux).

### **Q:** How do I run a console command on my multiplayer server?
* **Admin privledges:** You can access your multiplayer server's admin and console menu by first adding the `steam64id` of the player to the `Game.ini` file, into either the `AdminSteamIDs` or `SuperAdmin` values
* **Admin Menu vs Console:** You can access the console using the `~` developer options, but most commands will not work without first appending the `ServerExec` prefix to the command.  It is recommended that you use the game's `Admin Menu`, which can typically be accessed using the `\` or `Insert` keys.

`vein.AISpawner.SpawnCapMultiplierZombie=5` - as an example this would set your AI's zombie multiplier slider to 5x

This can also be adjusted manually by accessing the `Engine.ini` file within your server's file configuration location.
